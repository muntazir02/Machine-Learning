# Project Scope
The goal of this project is to scrape restaurant reviews from Google Maps and utilize the data to build a semantic search model. The model will be integrated into an API, allowing users to find the best matching restaurants based on review comparisons.

# Python Script for Scraping Reviews
To begin, we can create a Python script that scrapes reviews from Google Maps. By utilizing the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries, we can send a GET request to the Google Maps URL and parse the HTML content to extract the review details. The script retrieves the reviewer's name, rating, and review text, storing them in a list of dictionaries.

Please note that when scraping Google Maps or any other website, it is important to comply with the website's terms and conditions and respect any usage limitations or restrictions. Violating these terms could lead to legal consequences.

To implement the script, you can use the provided code as a starting point. Replace YOUR_PLACE_ID with the actual place ID of the restaurant you wish to scrape reviews for. Once executed, the script will print the scraped reviews, including the reviewer's name, rating, and review text.

Building a Semantic Search Model and API
Once the reviews have been scraped, the next step is to utilize the data to build a semantic search model. This model will allow users to find the best matching restaurants based on their review comparisons.

To build the model, you can employ various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. These may include pre-processing the review text, such as removing stop words, stemming or lemmatizing words, and converting the text into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.

After preprocessing the data, you can explore different approaches for semantic similarity matching, such as cosine similarity or word embeddings similarity. These techniques will enable you to compare new review texts against the existing reviews and identify the most similar ones.

Once the semantic search model is trained and validated, you can integrate it into an API. The API will provide an interface for users to input their query or review text. The model will then compare the input against the existing reviews and return the best matching restaurants based on the semantic similarity scores.

Remember to properly document your code, provide clear instructions for API usage, and ensure scalability and performance considerations when building the API.

# Conclusion
By scraping restaurant reviews from Google Maps and building a semantic search model, this project aims to provide users with a powerful tool for finding the best matching restaurants based on review comparisons. The integration of this model into an API will enable users to access the functionality easily.
